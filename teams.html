            <!-- <p class="card-text">A Canadian citizen and resident of Kenya, Virginia is an internationally trained lawyer holding a B.A. (Hons) in Psychology with a minor in Child
                and Family Studies, a Bachelor of Laws degree with a certificate in international human rights, and a Master of Laws degree obtained from Osgoode 
                Hall Law School in 2016, with expertise in research, critical legal analysis and advocacy on international, regional and domestic human rights issues. 
                Upon being called to the bar of Ontario in 2008 Virginia practised labour, constitutional and human rights private and public interest litigation in Canada,
               successfully advocating for organizational and systemic change before labour tribunals, professional discipline tribunals, human rights tribunals, and all levels of court. 
               Since relocating to Kenya in 2015 Virginia has engaged in empirical research, literature review, legislative drafting and policy development on a wide 
               variety of issues including access to justice, public health reform, devolution, child rights and protection, legal education reform, anti-corruption measures, police reform, access to information and penal reform.
               Virginia has researched and drafted legal and policy submissions, statutes and regulations, task force reports, research papers and legal opinions, represented NGOs and parastatals on coalitions, national task forces and at regional and international events, and made presentations and provided technical support to governments, parastatals, civil society, academic institutions, task forces and UN agencies on the domestic, regional and international human rights legal framework and contextual developments (including historical background, political and social structures, demographic changes and use of media) relevant to the realization of substantive equality and social, civil and political rights. Virginia has taught, hired, supervised and mentored law students and young lawyers, coached moot teams and participated as a judge in moot competitions, and developed and delivered public legal education materials and programs in both Canada and Kenya.
               When she is not fighting for the marginalized or mentoring young lawyers, Virginia enjoys physical activity (dancing, hiking, muay thai) and dabbles a little in acting.
